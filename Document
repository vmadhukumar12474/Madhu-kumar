Welcome! This repo captures my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**‚Äîa hands-on experience designing a RISC-V System-on-Chip from RTL coding to GDSII tapeout using open-source tools. As part of India‚Äôs biggest collaborative venture, 3500+ participants are enabled to build silicon and push the country‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem forward.

## üìÖ Week 0 ‚Äî Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|:-----|:------------|:-------|
| [**Task 0**](Week0/Task0/README.md) | üõ†Ô∏è Setting up essential open source EDA tools: **Icarus Verilog**, **Yosys**, and **GTKWave** | ‚úÖ Completed |

### üåü What I Learned This Week

- Successfully installed and verified key open-source EDA tools for digital design and simulation.
- Gained hands-on experience with the basic environment setup needed for RTL design.
- Laid the groundwork for the full RTL to GDSII digital flow upcoming in later weeks.
